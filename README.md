# TOP_tictactoe

A game of naughts and crosses for The Odin Project.

You pick a colour you want to be. The colour grays out once selected and whoever selects first, the other is not able to pick the same colour.
Once both players have picked their colours, the game begins. A dice is rolled to determine who goes first.
    - a O and a X are displayed above colours in gray, and the colour changes once the colour has been selected.
Each takes turns until the game is over. Scores are shown beside the coloured o/x, until someone presses reset which is right at the bottom.


## TODOs/changes
